    <p> For this post I decided to showcase three shows that I have absolutely fallen in love with. However, to keep these recommendations varied I decided to make sure to give you shows in different genres they showcase. So hopefully depending on your favourite genre I can give you a show you’ll enjoy!</p>

      <p>See you in my 19th life was a pleasant surprise watch during this summer. It may have been due to my extremely low expectations because I have been struggling finding a kdrama I genuinely enjoy. I have been watching k-dramas since 2017 and my biggest struggle is finding new, well-developed plots that keep me engaged. Before this kdrama I watched a couple of episodes of netflix’s highly popular romance drama “King The Land” airing at the same time and I did not find that enjoyable as I felt the show was just too stereotypically boring. I almost didn’t watch this kdrama thinking it is going to be the same-old romance plot. However, the best part of See you in my 19th life is its new but easily understandable plot. See you in my 19th life follows Ban Ji-eun, a woman that has lived for hundreds of years through her mysterious capability to reincarnate. She can remember all her past lives and struggles with her changes in races, gender and social class. In her eighteenth life, as a young korean girl she falls in love with a boy, however just as she promises to stay by his side, she is killed in a car accident. Now in her 19th life, Ji-eun makes it her goal to reunite with her now grown lover, without letting him know her true identity. I love this kdrama because all of the tropes within it I personally adore, as there is no-love triangle and secret identity. The topics in this kdrama are very emotional as it deals with tragic losses and trauma, however compared to other dramas, I truly believe that they showcase realistic interpretations to dealing with these struggles. If any of these tropes and plots sound interesting I highly suggest checking this 12-episode drama on Netflix.</p>
